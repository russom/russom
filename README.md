### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michelangelo.  
I've been writing SW for a variety of jobs: started as an Aerospace Engineer working on Flight Control Stystems and Simulators, and then somehow became a SW Architect working on IoT - quite a bit of fun so far... :sweat_smile:

- :package: &nbsp; :mortar_board: &nbsp; In 2020 and 2021 I completed 2 Nanodgrees from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/): one in [Self-Driving Car Engineering](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) and one in [Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). You can find the code for the Capstone projects [here](https://github.com/russom/CarND-Capstone) and [here](https://github.com/russom/DSND-Capstone), while I grouped the previous projects all together in two orgs [here](https://github.com/Self-Driving-Car-NDegree-M-Russo) and [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-NDegree-MRusso).
